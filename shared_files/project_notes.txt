# Project AgenticAI - Meeting Notes 2025-08-18

## Action Items:
- [x] Fix the 404 error in the client by using build_app() on the server.
- [ ] Implement a caching layer for the PDF text extraction to speed up subsequent requests.
- [ ] Add a new tool to summarize the content of a given resource file.
- [ ] Test the server's ability to handle at least 100 concurrent resource requests.

## Discussion Points:
- Should we return raw bytes for PDFs instead of extracted text?
- Need to add better error handling for unsupported file types.
- Investigate authentication methods for securing sensitive resources.`
